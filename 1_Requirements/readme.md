# Requirements

The Calculator should contain 0-9 numbers.

The Calculator must contain Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication Division,Square and Squareroot

## Introduction
 
A basic calculator is sometimes referred to as a 4-function calculator

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply,Square and Squareroot.

## Research
 We had Researched on how to build and how the calculator can be customer oriented.

## Cost and Features and Timeline

The cost of the calculator should be low as well as it should contain all the basic features.

## SWOT_ANALYSIS

Calculator are long-lasting, and they have almost all kinds of calculators such as basic, scientific, graphing, financial etc.

## Strengths

-   Saves Time
-   Automatic Calculations
-   No chance of errors in calculations of inputs are right
-   Feature to add square and square root

## Weaknesses

-    Cannot came back once forward to next step

## Opportunities

-    Can be implemented in any type of store or shops

## Threats

-    Other Similar Applications

# 4w's and 1H

## Who
   
The First solid state electronic was created by Blaise pascal.

## What

An electronic Calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform.

## When

The First calculator was build in early 1960s. and then later updated to pocket calculator in 1970s

## Where

Calculator was developed by intel for the japanese calculator company busicom

## How

Calculation is being able to perform all four airthmatic operations with minimal human interaction.

# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements

This project can be implemented by using c language in both windows and linux os.

This project will require all the input from user end and then it can perform required tasks on it

It should contain **Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Square and Squareroot**

Status:All the other Implementations will be done at later Part.


##  Low level Requirements

It should contain numerical values from 0-9
