# REPORT

# Requirements

The Calculator should contain 0-9 numbers.

The Calculator must contain Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication Division,Square and Squareroot

## Introduction
 
A basic calculator is sometimes referred to as a 4-function calculator

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply,Square and Squareroot.

## Research
 We had Researched on how to build and how the calculator can be customer oriented.

## Cost and Features and Timeline

The cost of the calculator should be low as well as it should contain all the basic features.

## SWOT_ANALYSIS

Calculator are long-lasting, and they have almost all kinds of calculators such as basic, scientific, graphing, financial etc.

## Strengths

-   Saves Time
-   Automatic Calculations
-   No chance of errors in calculations of inputs are right
-   Feature to add square and square root

## Weaknesses

-    Cannot came back, once forward to next step

## Opportunities

-    Can be implemented in any type of store or shops

## Threats

-    Other Similar Applications

# 4w's and 1H

## Who
   
The First solid state electronic was created by Blaise pascal.

## What

An electronic Calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform.

## When

The First calculator was build in early 1960s. and then later updated to pocket calculator in 1970s


## Where

Calculator was developed by intel for the japanese calculator company busicom

## How

Calculation is being able to perform all four airthmatic operations with minimal human interaction.


# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements

This project can be implemented by using c language in both windows and linux os.

This project will require all the input from user end and then it can perform required tasks on it

It should contain **Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Square and Squareroot**


Status:All the other Implementations will be done at later Part.


##  Low level Requirements

It should contain numerical values from 0-9

## HIGH LEVEL TEST PLAN

1.Check if the calculator is a normal calculator or a scientific calculator.

2.Verify that all the buttons are present and text written on them is readable.

3.Check the arithmetic operations are working fine- +, -, /, * etc.

4.Verify that BODMAS is applied in case of complex queries and the correct result is returned.

5.Verify that the calculator gives the correct result in case of operations containing decimal numbers.



## LOW LEVEL TEST PLAN

1.Verify the number of digits allowed to enter in the calculator for any operation.

2.Verify the limit of the response value.

3.Verify the functioning of memory functions.

4.Check if the calculator allows navigating through previous calculations

5.Verify that on pressing two operators one after the other, the latest one will override the previous operator.
